# CPU Chaste Chess

CPU Chaste Chess is the version of the game that goes back to using Software Surfaces which are processed with the Central Processing Unit rather than the Graphics Processing Unit. This was written because I wanted it to be compatible with even older systems which do not support the hardward accelerated graphics methods present in SDL version 2.
