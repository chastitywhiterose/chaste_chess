YaneuraOu

YaneuraOu is the world's strongest Shogi engine. One of the things that makes it difficult to get started using is that the documentation is all in Japanese and I rely on the web browser translating instructions from the wiki.

What makes YaneuraOu such an interesting engine is that it is used for the site lishogi.org. If you play against the level 2 or higher computer, you are playing against the YaneuraOu engine. This is how I found out about it in the first place.

However, there are a lot of different executable files in the archive that can be downloaded. The instructions are only so helpful because I don't know what the difference is between a KKPT, KPPT, or an NNUE. These are the advanced terms that chess engine developers know that I don't.

I can't tell you if what I am doing is correct, but I will document exactly what I did.

I selected the file "YaneuraOu_KPP_KKPT-V830Git_AVX2.exe" because it was the first in the list. I also knew that my CPU supports AVX2 instructions (whatever that means) because I was also using the AVX2 version of stockfish. So theoretically it should work.

winboard -fcp "C:\YaneuraOu\YaneuraOu_KPP_KKPT-V830Git_AVX2.exe" -fUSI -variant shogi -xclock -depth 1

However, it didn't work exactly. It crashed and I don't know why. I will try different things later.
