Engines I have installed.

/usr/games/stockfish (doesn't work with xboard, will look into this)
/usr/games/fairy-stockfish
/usr/games/gnuchess

Common commands to run xboard on my system with the game settings I want.


xboard -fcp "/usr/games/stockfish"

xboard -fcp "/usr/games/fairy-stockfish"

xboard -fcp "/usr/games/gnuchess"



----
Commands proven to work on my Linux system to play the games I want.


xboard -fcp "/usr/games/fairy-stockfish" -variant chess
xboard -fcp "/usr/games/fairy-stockfish" -variant shogi
xboard -fcp "/usr/games/fairy-stockfish" -variant xiangqi

On Windows, the same principle applies but it is called winboard and you must put it in your path manually or be in that directory to run a command.

For example:

winboard -fcp "C:\stockfish\fairy-stockfish.exe" -variant shogi

A better example is to customize the depth of which the engine searches for its moves.

winboard -fcp "C:\stockfish\fairy-stockfish.exe" -variant shogi -depth 1

Or specifying a time limit for the computer to choose its move.

Because xboard/winboard does not seem to have a dialog option to turn off the clock, you can instead use the "-xclock" flag to the command to turn off the clock entirely. This is the best thing to do because playing without a time limit is much more relaxing!

winboard -fcp "C:\stockfish\fairy-stockfish.exe" -variant normal -xclock -depth 1
winboard -fcp "C:\stockfish\fairy-stockfish.exe" -variant shogi -xclock -depth 1
winboard -fcp "C:\stockfish\fairy-stockfish.exe" -variant xiangqi -xclock -depth 1


Using regular stockfish:

I discovered that it is possible to use regular stockfish if you pass the "-fUCI" flag to it when selecting it as the first chess program. This lets xboard know that the engine uses UCI protocol instead of the xboard protocol that other engines sometimes use.

winboard -fcp "C:\stockfish\stockfish.exe" -fUCI -variant normal -xclock -depth 1
